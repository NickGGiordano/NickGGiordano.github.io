      <description>I am a solution architect with over 20 years of experience in large software design and development. I have a graduate diploma in software engineering.
I have worked on many large companies (banks, insurance companies, telecoms, etc.) both as a consultant and as a regular employe.
I specialize in complex system design, transactional systems, data modeling and Java &amp;amp; Angular software design.
During the last few years, I had the chance to work as a solutions architect on major projects, to optimize development processes, participate in the implantation of practices to improve quality (unit testing, code review, design review) and to train and mentor developers.</description>
